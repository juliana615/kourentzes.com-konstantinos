<p>when an immovable object is continuously eroded by a not so significant force</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ve seen many cases over the years of political parties making room for that fringe politician who may or may not have something different or even sane to add to the mix, yet he is accepted because of the significant voting power he/she seems to command.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What political parties fail to understand is that maybe for a few years the  rest of the majority might acknowledge the existence or even allow those people to impress upon their political views but there comes a point that "ordinary" people representing the majority, do not want to be associated with these views.</p>

<p>At this point is when the unthinkable happens, the people abandoning gradually become more than the voters supporting but there is no easily discernible metric so the erosion takes many more years to become apparent and the damage is much more significant. And somehow now the previously fringe views within that party become prevalent because they represent a vocal part of the majority and not some insignificant minority.</p>

<p>Now that their existence has become important for the majority, it's when the ouroboros effect takes place, it continuous eat upon themselves to keep them, yet they feel, they can't afford to cast them out. But unlike the perpetually self eating snake of the Greek mythology to keep going they are now spiraling downwards not only eroding from voters within but not allowing to attract new ones.</p>
